# APK Sentinel

**AI-assisted Android APK static security analysis platform.**

> ⚠️ **This MVP performs static analysis only. Uploaded APKs are not installed or executed.**

## Overview

APK Sentinel is a web-based platform that allows users to upload Android APK files for automated static security analysis. The system decompiles the APK inside an isolated Docker container, runs a battery of analyzers, computes a deterministic risk score, and generates an AI-powered security assessment report.

### Key Principles

1. **Static analysis first** — APKs are decoded/decompiled, never executed
2. **Deterministic scoring** — The LLM never calculates or overrides the risk score
3. **Explainable results** — Every score point has a traceable rule, evidence, and explanation
4. **Evidence-based findings** — Findings are indicators, never definitive malware claims
5. **Isolated analysis** — Untrusted APKs are analyzed inside a sandboxed Docker container

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite |
| Frontend | React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v3 |
| Analysis | APKTool 2.10.0, JADX 1.5.5, Python |
| AI | Groq API (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) |
| Isolation | Docker (non-root, no network, resource limits) |

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend development)
- Python 3.12+ (for backend development)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url> && cd sentinel

# Copy environment file
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and set GROQ_API_KEY

# Build the analyzer container
docker build -t apk-sentinel-analyzer ./analyzer

# Start all services
docker compose up --build
```

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Local Development (without Docker)

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy database URL | `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./sentinel.db` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Groq API key (required for AI reports) | — |
| `VIRUSTOTAL_LOOKUP_ENABLED` | Enable hash-only VirusTotal report lookup | `false` |
| `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` | VirusTotal Community API key; required when lookup is enabled | — |
| `MAX_APK_SIZE_MB` | Maximum upload size in MB | `100` |
| `ANALYSIS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Hard timeout for analyzer container | `900` |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed CORS origins (JSON array) | `["http://localhost:5173"]` |

VirusTotal integration is optional and performs a hash lookup only. Set
`VIRUSTOTAL_LOOKUP_ENABLED=true` and provide `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` in
`backend/.env` to enable it. APK Sentinel does not upload APK bytes to
VirusTotal; if no report exists or the lookup is unavailable, its own static
scan still runs. A hash lookup is externally visible to VirusTotal, so enable
it only for files you are permitted to query.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/analyses` | Upload APK and create analysis |
| `GET` | `/api/analyses` | List all analyses (paginated) |
| `GET` | `/api/analyses/{id}` | Get analysis status/metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/analyses/{id}/results` | Get structured findings + score |
| `GET` | `/api/analyses/{id}/report` | Get AI security report |
| `DELETE` | `/api/analyses/{id}` | Delete analysis and cleanup |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check |

## Scoring Methodology

The **Static Security Risk Score** (0-100) is computed by a deterministic engine:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Permission Risk | 25% | Individual permissions + correlation rules |
| Code/API Risk | 35% | Security-sensitive API usage patterns |
| Component Exposure | 20% | Exported components and protection status |
| Indicators/Metadata | 20% | Secrets, network indicators, obfuscation |

### Risk Levels

| Range | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 0–20 | LOW |
| 21–40 | MODERATE |
| 41–60 | MEDIUM |
| 61–80 | HIGH |
| 81–100 | CRITICAL |

Every score contribution includes: `rule_id`, `category`, `severity`, `points`, `evidence`, `explanation`.

## Threat Model & Security

### Primary Threat

The main threat is **malicious or malformed APK input**. Users upload untrusted Android application packages that could contain:

- Malformed archive structures designed to exploit decompilation tools
- Extremely large files intended to exhaust resources
- Path traversal filenames

### Container Isolation

The analyzer container is the primary security boundary:

| Control | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Non-root execution | Container runs as `analyzer` user |
| No network | `network_mode=none` |
| No privileges | `privileged=false` |
| No Docker socket | Not mounted |
| No host filesystem | Controlled volume mounts only |
| Resource limits | CPU quota + memory limit (512MB) |
| Hard timeout | Container killed after 300s |
| Read-only input | APK mounted as read-only |
| Tmpfs for tools | APKTool/JADX temp dirs on tmpfs |
| Cleanup | Container + workspace removed after completion |

### What the Analyzer Can and Cannot Prove

| Can Detect | Cannot Determine |
|------------|-----------------|
| Dangerous permissions | User consent context |
| Exported components | Runtime behavior |
| Suspicious API patterns | Actual data exfiltration |
| Hardcoded secrets | Whether secrets are test/prod |
| Obfuscation indicators | Malicious intent |
| Network indicators | Active C2 communication |

### Separation of Detection and Explanation

The system deliberately separates:

1. **Deterministic detection/scoring** (backend engine) — objective, reproducible, auditable
2. **LLM-based explanation** (Groq) — human-readable interpretation of deterministic findings

The LLM never overrides scores or makes malware determinations. If the LLM fails, all static analysis results remain available.

## Limitations

- Static analysis only — no runtime behavior observation
- Cannot detect time-delayed or conditional malicious behavior
- Cannot verify if detected permissions are actually used at runtime
- Obfuscated code may limit decompilation quality
- Network indicators are extracted, not verified against threat intelligence
- Secret detection uses pattern matching, not confirmed credential validation
- AI report quality depends on LLM model capabilities and availability

## Future Extensibility

The analyzer architecture supports adding new modules:

- `YaraAnalyzer` — YARA rule matching
- `DynamicAnalyzer` — Runtime analysis via isolated Android emulator (separate pipeline)
- Threat intelligence integration for network indicators
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
- Comparative analysis across APK versions

Dynamic analysis, when implemented, must use a completely separate isolated Android emulator/sandbox environment and would observe: runtime API calls, filesystem changes, network traffic, DNS queries, and process behavior.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests use safe synthetic APK fixtures. **No real malware is used in testing.**
